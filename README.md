# Logistic Regression Project

This project is part of the **Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass** by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/).

It demonstrates how **Logistic Regression** can be applied to solve a binary classification problem — predicting whether an observation belongs to class 0 or class 1 based on input features.

## 🧠 Overview

The project covers:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling and preprocessing
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of performance metrics (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was provided as part of the course materials.  
It consists of multiple numerical and categorical features used to predict a binary target variable.

*(You can replace this section with the actual dataset name if you know it, e.g., “Advertising Dataset” or “Heart Disease Dataset.”)*
